Practice with geospatial analysis using rasters. Mini-homework for DSC170.

We decided to do a small wind farm suitability analysis for San Diego.
Our suitability model explores areas in San Diego that are suitable for windmills. 
We will take into account land cover type and surface slope to decide if it is a good place for a wind farm. 
Our hypothesis is that areas that are flat, or has small slope, and close to transmission lines are suitable and we did some
online research to find favorable conditions for wind farms. 
Furthermore, the area should be relatively "empty" in the sense that there are no other development or habitants.
